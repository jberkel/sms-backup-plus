Hi,
I 've translated your fabulous app SMS Backup+ to Slovak. I translated the "plurals" and "strings" files taken from the latest version 1.4.5. Files were sent to your email.
 
I hope you can add the Slovak translation to the next update. How do you handle updating of translations?
 
Have a nice day,
